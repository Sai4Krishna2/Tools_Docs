# Monitoring & Observability 📈

## What is Monitoring & Observability? 🤔
Monitoring involves tracking the performance and health of systems, while observability focuses on understanding system behavior through logs, metrics, and traces.

---

## Why is Monitoring & Observability Important? 🌟
- 🔍 **Detect Issues Early**: Identifies performance bottlenecks and failures.
- 🚨 **Improves Reliability**: Ensures systems are running as expected.
- 📊 **Provides Insights**: Helps in understanding system behavior and trends.

---

## Key Concepts 📚
1. **Metrics**: Quantitative data about system performance (e.g., CPU usage, memory).
2. **Logs**: Detailed records of system events.
3. **Traces**: Tracks the flow of requests across distributed systems.
