# DevOps üõ†Ô∏è

## What is DevOps? ü§î
DevOps is a set of practices that combines **software development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)**. It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software efficiently.

## Why is DevOps Important? üåü
- üöÄ **Faster delivery of software**: Automate and streamline processes.
- ü§ù **Improved collaboration**: Break down silos between development and operations teams.
- üîß **Higher reliability and scalability**: Build robust and scalable systems.

## Key Concepts üìö
1. **CI/CD**: Automating the integration and deployment of code.
2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure using code for consistency and repeatability.
3. **Monitoring**: Keeping track of system performance and ensuring reliability.
