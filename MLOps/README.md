# MLOps

## What is MLOps?
MLOps is a set of practices for managing the lifecycle of machine learning models, from development to deployment and monitoring.

## Why is MLOps Important?
- Ensures reproducibility of ML experiments.
- Simplifies model deployment.
- Monitors model performance in production.

## Key Concepts
1. **Experiment Tracking**: Keeping track of ML experiments.
2. **Model Deployment**: Deploying models to production.
3. **Monitoring**: Tracking model performance over time.

## Tools
- **MLflow**: Tracks ML experiments and manages models.
- **Kubeflow**: Manages ML workflows on Kubernetes.
- **TensorFlow Serving**: Deploys TensorFlow models.
