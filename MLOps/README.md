# MLOps ü§ñ

## What is MLOps? ü§î
MLOps is a set of practices for managing the lifecycle of machine learning models, from development to deployment and monitoring.

---

## Why is MLOps Important? üåü
- üîÑ **Ensures reproducibility**: Tracks ML experiments and results.
- üöÄ **Simplifies deployment**: Deploys models to production environments.
- üìä **Monitors performance**: Tracks model behavior in real-time.

## Key Concepts üìö
1. **Experiment Tracking**: Keeping track of ML experiments and results.
2. **Model Deployment**: Deploying models to production environments.
3. **Monitoring**: Tracking model performance over time.
