# DevSecOps

## What is DevSecOps?
DevSecOps integrates security practices into the DevOps workflow to ensure secure software delivery.

## Why is DevSecOps Important?
- Identifies vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- Automates security checks.
- Reduces risks in production.

## Key Concepts
1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyzing code for vulnerabilities.
2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Testing running applications for vulnerabilities.
3. **Secrets Management**: Securing sensitive information like API keys.

## Tools
- **OWASP ZAP**: Dynamic application security testing tool.
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis.
- **Snyk**: Finds and fixes vulnerabilities in dependencies.
